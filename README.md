## Dev Notes

A founding idea since the creation of **Altera Labs**, HumorHealer was our sandbox to experiment with the capabilities of Large Language Model APIs â€” to see how we could stretch and tune them to fit specific use-cases.

At its core, HumorHealer represents the main goal of our organization:  
To help people in meaningful ways through technology.

Whether taking on larger and more complex challenges in future projects, or iterating and improving on existing ones, we will strive to continue upholding these principles in all that we do.
